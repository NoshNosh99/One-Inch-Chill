<h1>The One-Inch Chill</h1>
<h2>A Longitudinal Study of Men Who Are Never Warm</h2>
<small>Northbridge Institute Review, Sunday Edition</small>

<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> Cold intolerance is common. Chronic cold obsession is not. Yet one group of men remains permanently frozen despite layers, heating, and hope.</p>

<p><strong>Methodology.</strong> Subjects were observed across parks, pavements, pubs, and golf courses. Layer counts escalated rapidly. Comfort never appeared.</p>

<p><strong>Thermal Failure Profile.</strong> Jackets fail symbolically. Scarves tighten. Gloves remain on indoors. Heat escapes instantly.</p>

<p><strong>The Complaint Loop.</strong> “It’s freezing” appears regardless of temperature. The phrase repeats until acknowledged.</p>

<p><strong>Golf Course Case Study.</strong> Sunday mornings produce peak dysfunction. Wind becomes personal. Shade is resented. Golf ends early.</p>

<p><strong>Indoor Behaviour.</strong> Radiators glow. Blankets stack. Warmth never arrives.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong> Sub-one-inch anatomy predicts lifelong cold exposure. Winter confirms it annually.</p>
